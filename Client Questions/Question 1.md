Subject: Bad design

Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Thanks,
Marissa

## Answer

Hello Marissa,

I am very sorry to hear that you don't like the new dashboard. I will forward your feeback to the product team.

Meanwhile you can access your top indices from the bottom of the dashboard Overview.

Another option is to use the API through the Algolia CLI to clear or/and delete the indices (See [Clear records from an index with the API](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/manage-indices-and-apps/manage-indices/how-to/delete-indices/?client=CLI#clear-records-from-an-index-with-the-api) and [Delete indices with the API](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/manage-indices-and-apps/manage-indices/how-to/delete-indices/?client=CLI#delete-indices-with-the-api)). It is only one line to run from a terminal. You wouldn't have to leave your development environment. I would be happy to assist if it seems like a good alternative solution.

I hope thatâ€™s helpful, please let me know if you have any further questions.

Regards,\
Louis

## Observation and Comments

I can't remember how the old dashboard was although I probably used it. The "Top Indices" section at the end of the "Overview" page is nice. But I could maybe suggest a new "Favorite Indices" feature. You could "star" an index and they would appear at the top of the "Overview" page for an even easier access.
